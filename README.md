Movie-Recommender-with-NLP

This is a project about making movie recommendations. I created 3 models which accept a movie from a user and return the n most similar movies to the user. My 1st model uses tf-idf and cosine similarity; my 2nd uses Jaccard Similarity; my 3rd uses word counts and cosine similarity. 

I created my own dataset using IMDb's public datasets and the IMDbPY API.
